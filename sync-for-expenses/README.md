## SDK Example Usage

### Example

```python
# Synchronous Example
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses

with CodatSyncExpenses() as codat_sync_expenses:
    codat_sync_expenses.client_rate_limit_reached(request={
        "event_type": "client.rateLimit.reached",
        "generated_date": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z",
        "id": "743ec94a-8aa4-44bb-8bd4-e1855ee0e74b",
        "payload": {
            "daily_quota": 12000,
            "expiry_date": "2024-09-01T12:14:14Z",
            "quota_remaining": 0,
        },
    })

    # Use the SDK ...
```

</br>

The same SDK client can also be used to make asychronous requests by importing asyncio.
```python
# Asynchronous Example
import asyncio
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses

async def main():
    async with CodatSyncExpenses() as codat_sync_expenses:
        await codat_sync_expenses.client_rate_limit_reached_async(request={
            "event_type": "client.rateLimit.reached",
            "generated_date": "2024-09-01T00:00:00Z",
            "id": "743ec94a-8aa4-44bb-8bd4-e1855ee0e74b",
            "payload": {
                "daily_quota": 12000,
                "expiry_date": "2024-09-01T12:14:14Z",
                "quota_remaining": 0,
            },
        })

        # Use the SDK ...

asyncio.run(main())
```

<!-- Start File uploads [file-upload] -->
## File uploads

Certain SDK methods accept file objects as part of a request body or multi-part request. It is possible and typically recommended to upload files as a stream rather than reading the entire contents into memory. This avoids excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing with out-of-memory errors when working with very large files. The following example demonstrates how to attach a file stream to a request.

> [!TIP]
>
> For endpoints that handle file uploads bytes arrays can also be used. However, using streams is recommended for large files.
>

```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
from codat_sync_for_expenses.models import shared

with CodatSyncExpenses(
    security=shared.Security(
        auth_header="Basic BASE_64_ENCODED(API_KEY)",
    ),
) as codat_sync_expenses:
    res = codat_sync_expenses.attachments.upload(request={
        "company_id": "8a210b68-6988-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002",
        "sync_id": "6fb40d5e-b13e-11ed-afa1-0242ac120002",
        "transaction_id": "336694d8-2dca-4cb5-a28d-3ccb83e55eee",
    })

    if res is not None:
        # handle response
        pass

```
<!-- End File uploads [file-upload] -->

<!-- Start Retries [retries] -->
## Retries

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support retries. If you use the SDK without any configuration, it will fall back to the default retry strategy provided by the API. However, the default retry strategy can be overridden on a per-operation basis, or across the entire SDK.

To change the default retry strategy for a single API call, simply provide a `RetryConfig` object to the call:
```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
from codat_sync_for_expenses.models import shared
from codat_sync_for_expenses.utils import BackoffStrategy, RetryConfig

with CodatSyncExpenses(
    security=shared.Security(
        auth_header="Basic BASE_64_ENCODED(API_KEY)",
    ),
) as codat_sync_expenses:
    res = codat_sync_expenses.companies.create(request={
        "name": "Technicalium",
    },
        RetryConfig("backoff", BackoffStrategy(1, 50, 1.1, 100), False))

    if res is not None:
        # handle response
        pass

```

If you'd like to override the default retry strategy for all operations that support retries, you can use the `retry_config` optional parameter when initializing the SDK:
```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
from codat_sync_for_expenses.models import shared
from codat_sync_for_expenses.utils import BackoffStrategy, RetryConfig

with CodatSyncExpenses(
    retry_config=RetryConfig("backoff", BackoffStrategy(1, 50, 1.1, 100), False),
    security=shared.Security(
        auth_header="Basic BASE_64_ENCODED(API_KEY)",
    ),
) as codat_sync_expenses:
    res = codat_sync_expenses.companies.create(request={
        "name": "Technicalium",
    })

    if res is not None:
        # handle response
        pass

```
<!-- End Retries [retries] -->

<!-- Start Error Handling [errors] -->
## Error Handling

Handling errors in this SDK should largely match your expectations. All operations return a response object or raise an exception.

By default, an API error will raise a errors.SDKError exception, which has the following properties:

| Property        | Type             | Description           |
|-----------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| `.status_code`  | *int*            | The HTTP status code  |
| `.message`      | *str*            | The error message     |
| `.raw_response` | *httpx.Response* | The raw HTTP response |
| `.body`         | *str*            | The response content  |

When custom error responses are specified for an operation, the SDK may also raise their associated exceptions. You can refer to respective *Errors* tables in SDK docs for more details on possible exception types for each operation. For example, the `create_async` method may raise the following exceptions:

| Error Type          | Status Code                       | Content Type     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| errors.ErrorMessage | 400, 401, 402, 403, 429, 500, 503 | application/json |
| errors.SDKError     | 4XX, 5XX                          | \*/\*            |

### Example

```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
from codat_sync_for_expenses.models import errors, shared

with CodatSyncExpenses(
    security=shared.Security(
        auth_header="Basic BASE_64_ENCODED(API_KEY)",
    ),
) as codat_sync_expenses:
    res = None
    try:
        res = codat_sync_expenses.companies.create(request={
            "name": "Technicalium",
        })

        if res is not None:
            # handle response
            pass

    except errors.ErrorMessage as e:
        # handle e.data: errors.ErrorMessageData
        raise(e)
    except errors.SDKError as e:
        # handle exception
        raise(e)
```
<!-- End Error Handling [errors] -->

<!-- Start Server Selection [server] -->
## Server Selection

### Override Server URL Per-Client

The default server can also be overridden globally by passing a URL to the `server_url: str` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
from codat_sync_for_expenses.models import shared

with CodatSyncExpenses(
    server_url="https://api.codat.io",
    security=shared.Security(
        auth_header="Basic BASE_64_ENCODED(API_KEY)",
    ),
) as codat_sync_expenses:
    res = codat_sync_expenses.companies.create(request={
        "name": "Technicalium",
    })

    if res is not None:
        # handle response
        pass

```
<!-- End Server Selection [server] -->

<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->
## Custom HTTP Client

The Python SDK makes API calls using the [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) HTTP library.  In order to provide a convenient way to configure timeouts, cookies, proxies, custom headers, and other low-level configuration, you can initialize the SDK client with your own HTTP client instance.
Depending on whether you are using the sync or async version of the SDK, you can pass an instance of `HttpClient` or `AsyncHttpClient` respectively, which are Protocol's ensuring that the client has the necessary methods to make API calls.
This allows you to wrap the client with your own custom logic, such as adding custom headers, logging, or error handling, or you can just pass an instance of `httpx.Client` or `httpx.AsyncClient` directly.

For example, you could specify a header for every request that this sdk makes as follows:
```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
import httpx

http_client = httpx.Client(headers={"x-custom-header": "someValue"})
s = CodatSyncExpenses(client=http_client)
```

or you could wrap the client with your own custom logic:
```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
from codat_sync_for_expenses.httpclient import AsyncHttpClient
import httpx

class CustomClient(AsyncHttpClient):
    client: AsyncHttpClient

    def __init__(self, client: AsyncHttpClient):
        self.client = client

    async def send(
        self,
        request: httpx.Request,
        *,
        stream: bool = False,
        auth: Union[
            httpx._types.AuthTypes, httpx._client.UseClientDefault, None
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
        follow_redirects: Union[
            bool, httpx._client.UseClientDefault
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
    ) -> httpx.Response:
        request.headers["Client-Level-Header"] = "added by client"

        return await self.client.send(
            request, stream=stream, auth=auth, follow_redirects=follow_redirects
        )

    def build_request(
        self,
        method: str,
        url: httpx._types.URLTypes,
        *,
        content: Optional[httpx._types.RequestContent] = None,
        data: Optional[httpx._types.RequestData] = None,
        files: Optional[httpx._types.RequestFiles] = None,
        json: Optional[Any] = None,
        params: Optional[httpx._types.QueryParamTypes] = None,
        headers: Optional[httpx._types.HeaderTypes] = None,
        cookies: Optional[httpx._types.CookieTypes] = None,
        timeout: Union[
            httpx._types.TimeoutTypes, httpx._client.UseClientDefault
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
        extensions: Optional[httpx._types.RequestExtensions] = None,
    ) -> httpx.Request:
        return self.client.build_request(
            method,
            url,
            content=content,
            data=data,
            files=files,
            json=json,
            params=params,
            headers=headers,
            cookies=cookies,
            timeout=timeout,
            extensions=extensions,
        )

s = CodatSyncExpenses(async_client=CustomClient(httpx.AsyncClient()))
```
<!-- End Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->

<!-- Start Authentication [security] -->
## Authentication

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name          | Type   | Scheme  |
| ------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `auth_header` | apiKey | API key |

You can set the security parameters through the `security` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
from codat_sync_for_expenses.models import shared

with CodatSyncExpenses(
    security=shared.Security(
        auth_header="Basic BASE_64_ENCODED(API_KEY)",
    ),
) as codat_sync_expenses:
    res = codat_sync_expenses.companies.create(request={
        "name": "Technicalium",
    })

    if res is not None:
        # handle response
        pass

```
<!-- End Authentication [security] -->

<!-- Start Debugging [debug] -->
## Debugging

You can setup your SDK to emit debug logs for SDK requests and responses.

You can pass your own logger class directly into your SDK.
```python
from codat_sync_for_expenses import CodatSyncExpenses
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
s = CodatSyncExpenses(debug_logger=logging.getLogger("codat_sync_for_expenses"))
```
<!-- End Debugging [debug] -->
