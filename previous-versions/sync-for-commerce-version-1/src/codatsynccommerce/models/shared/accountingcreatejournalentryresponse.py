    ## Overview

    A journal entry report shows the entries made in a company's general ledger, or [accounts](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Account), when transactions are approved. The journal line items for each journal entry should balance.

    A journal entry line item is a single transaction line on the journal entry. For example: 

    - When a journal entry is recording a receipt of cash, the credit to accounts receivable and the debit to cash are separate line items. 
    - When a company needs to recognise revenue from an annual contract on a monthly basis, on receipt of cash for month one, they make a debit to deferred income and a credit to revenue.

    In Codat a journal entry contains details of:

    - The date on which the entry was created and posted.
    - Itemised lines, including amounts and currency.
    - A reference to the associated accounts.
    - A reference to the underlying record. For example, the invoice, bill, or other data type that triggered the posting of the journal entry to the general ledger. 

    > **Pushing journal entries**  
    > Codat only supports journal entries in the base currency of the company that are pushed into accounts denominated in the same base currency.
