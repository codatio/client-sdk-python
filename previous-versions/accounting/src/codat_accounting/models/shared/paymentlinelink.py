    currency_rate: NotRequired[Nullable[Decimal]]
    r"""Rate to convert the total amount of the payment into the base currency for the company at the time of the payment.

    Currency rates in Codat are implemented as the multiple of foreign currency units to each base currency unit.

    It is not possible to perform the currency conversion with two or more non-base currencies participating in the transaction. For example, if a company's base currency is USD, and it has a bill issued in EUR, then the bill payment must happen in USD or EUR.

    Where the currency rate is provided by the underlying accounting software, it will be available from Codat with the same precision (up to a maximum of 9 decimal places).

    For accounting software which do not provide an explicit currency rate, it is calculated as `baseCurrency / foreignCurrency` and will be returned to 9 decimal places.
