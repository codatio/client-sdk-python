    ## Overview

    An invoice is an itemized record of goods sold or services provided to a [customer](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Customer).

    In Codat, an invoice contains details of:

    - The timeline of the invoice—when it was raised, marked as paid, last edited, and so on.
    - How much the invoice is for, what portion of the invoice is tax or discounts, and what currency the amounts are represented in.
    - Who the invoice has been raised to; the _customer_.
    - The breakdown of what the invoice is for; the _line items_.
    - Any [payments](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/Payment) assigned to the invoice; the _payment allocations_.
