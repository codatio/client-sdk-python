    ## Overview
    
    The balance sheet is a snapshot of a company's accounts at a single point in time that provides a statement of the assets, liabilities and equity of an organization. It gives interested parties an idea of the company's financial position, in addition to displaying what the company owns and owes.
    
    > **Balance sheet or profit and loss report?**
    >
    > A profit and loss report summarises the total revenue, expenses, and profit or loss during a specified time period. A balance sheet report shows the financial position of a company at a specific moment in time.
    
    **Structure of this report**
    This report will reflect the structure and line descriptions that the business has set in their own accounting platform.
    
    **History**
    By default, Codat pulls (up to) 24 months of balance sheets for a company. You can adjust this to fetch more history, where available, by updating the `monthsToSync` value for `balanceSheet` on the [data type settings endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/codat-api#/operations/post-profile-syncSettings).
    
    **Want to pull this in a standardised structure?**
    Our [Enhanced Financials](https://docs.codat.io/assess/reports/enhanced-financials/financials) endpoints provide the same report under standardized headings, allowing you to pull it in the same format for all of your business customers.
