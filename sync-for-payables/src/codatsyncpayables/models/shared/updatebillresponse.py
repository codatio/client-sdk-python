    ## Overview

    In Codat, a bill contains details of:
    * When the bill was recorded in the accounting system.
    * How much the bill is for and the currency of the amount.
    * Who the bill was received from — the *supplier*.
    * What the bill is for — the *line items*.

    Some accounting platforms give a separate name to purchases where the payment is made immediately, such as something bought with a credit card or online payment. One example of this would be QuickBooks Online's *expenses*.

    You can find these types of transactions in our [Direct costs](https://docs.codat.io/accounting-api#/schemas/DirectCost) data model.
