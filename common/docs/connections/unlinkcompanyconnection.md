# unlink_company_connection
Available in: `connections`

This allows you to deauthorize a connection, without deleting it from Codat. This means you can still view any data that has previously been pulled into Codat, and also lets you re-authorize in future if your customer wishes to resume sharing their data.

## Example Usage
```python
import codatcommon
from codatcommon.models import operations

s = codatcommon.CodatCommon(
    security=shared.Security(
        auth_header="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    ),
)


req = operations.UnlinkCompanyConnectionRequest(
    request_body=operations.UnlinkCompanyConnectionRequestBody(
        status="placeat",
    ),
    company_id="8a210b68-6988-11ed-a1eb-0242ac120002",
    connection_id="2e9d2c44-f675-40ba-8049-353bfcb5e171",
)

res = s.connections.unlink_company_connection(req)

if res.connection is not None:
    # handle response
```
