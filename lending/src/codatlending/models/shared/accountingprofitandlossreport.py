    r"""> **Language tip:** Profit and loss statement is also referred to as **income statement** under US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles).

    ## Overview

    The purpose of a profit and loss report is to present the financial performance of a company over a specified time period.

    A profit and loss report shows a company's total income and expenses for a specified period of time and whether a profit or loss has been made.

    > **Profit and loss or balance sheet?**  
    > Profit and loss reports summarise the total revenue, expenses, and profit or loss over a specified time period. A balance sheet report presents all assets, liability, and equity for a given date.


    **Structure of this report**  
    This report will reflect the structure and line descriptions that the business has set in their own accounting platform.

    **History**  
    By default, Codat pulls (up to) 24 months of profit and loss history for a company. You can adjust this to fetch more history, where available, by updating the `monthsToSync` value for `profitAndLoss` on the [data type settings endpoint](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/post-profile-syncSettings).

    **Want to pull this in a standardised structure?**  
    Our [Enhanced Financials](https://docs.codat.io/assess/reports/enhanced-financials/financials) endpoints provide the same report under standardized headings, allowing you to pull it in the same format for all of your business customers.
