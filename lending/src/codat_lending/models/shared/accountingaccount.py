class AccountingAccountValidDataTypeLinksTypedDict(TypedDict):
    r"""When querying Codat's data model, some data types return `validDatatypeLinks` metadata in the JSON response. This indicates where that object can be used as a reference—a _valid link_—when creating or updating other data.

    For example, `validDatatypeLinks` might indicate the following references:

    - Which tax rates are valid to use on the line item of a bill.
    - Which items can be used when creating an invoice.

    You can use `validDatatypeLinks` to present your SMB customers with only valid choices when selecting objects from a list, for example.

    ## `validDatatypeLinks` example

    The following example uses the `Accounting.Accounts` data type. It shows that, on the linked integration, this account is valid as the account on a payment or bill payment; and as the account referenced on the line item of a direct income or direct cost. Because there is no valid link to Invoices or Bills, using this account on those data types will result in an error.

    ```json validDatatypeLinks for an account
    {
    \"id\": \"bd9e85e0-0478-433d-ae9f-0b3c4f04bfe4\",
    \"nominalCode\": \"090\",

    ## Support for `validDatatypeLinks`

    Codat currently supports `validDatatypeLinks` for some data types on our Xero, QuickBooks Online, QuickBooks Desktop, Exact (NL), and Sage Business Cloud integrations.

    If you'd like us to extend support to more data types or integrations, suggest or vote for this on our <a href=\"https://portal.productboard.com/codat/5-product-roadmap\">Product Roadmap</a>.

    ## Overview

    Accounts are the categories a business uses to record accounting transactions. From the Accounts endpoints, you can retrieve a list of all accounts for a specified company.

    The categories for an account include:
    * Asset
    * Expense
    * Income
    * Liability
    * Equity.

    The same account may have a different category based on the integration it is used in. For example, a current account (known as checking in the US) should be categorized as `Asset.Current` for Xero, and `Asset.Bank.Checking` for QuickBooks Online.

    At the same time, each integration may have its own requirements to the categories. For example, a Paypal account in Xero is of the `Asset.Bank` category and therefore requires additional properties to be provided.

    To determine the list of allowed categories for a specific integration, you can:
    - Follow our [Create, update, delete data](https://docs.codat.io/using-the-api/push) guide and use the [Get create account model](https://docs.codat.io/lending-api#/operations/get-create-chartOfAccounts-model).
    - Refer to the integration's own documentation.

    > **Accounts with no category**
    >
    > If an account is pulled from the chart of accounts and its nominal code does not lie within the category layout for the company's accounts, then the **type** is `Unknown`. The **fullyQualifiedCategory** and **fullyQualifiedName** fields return `null`.
    >
    > This approach gives a true representation of the company's accounts whilst preventing distorting financials such as a company's profit and loss and balance sheet reports.
